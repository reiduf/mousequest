# MouseQuest: Disneyland Community Scavenger Hunts
My absolute favorite part about visiting Disney parks is the level of detail in attractions and hidden easter eggs throughout the park. I was born and raised a Disney fan so all the infamous Disneyland secrets were passed down to me at a young age. My parents often created their own "scavenger hunts" for my brother and I to complete, often involving Hidden Mickey's, little bits of park history, or a must eat snack item. I found out when I got older that this is a common practice for Disney lovers to create their own "must do's" and such for their friends and family to complete to fully immersify themselves in the parks. MouseQuest serves to connect family traditions and creative Disney fans everywhere to share their favorite quests and hidden gems!

MouseQuest offers several categories of quests that users can sift through to match their needs, from kid friendly to hidden Mickey quests to queue line quests and more. Users can like and accept any community quest or create their own for everyone to enjoy.
